== How to run the tests

The options for running the test suite are summarized below.

As entry point the API landing page of an OGC API - Tiles instance is expected.

=== 1. Integrated development environment (IDE)

Use a Java IDE such as Eclipse, NetBeans, or IntelliJ. Clone the repository and build the project.

Set the main class to run: `org.opengis.cite.ogcapitiles10.TestNGController`

Arguments: The first argument must refer to an XML properties file containing the
required test run arguments. If not specified, the default location at `$
{user.home}/test-run-props.xml` will be used.

You can modify the sample file in `src/main/config/test-run-props.xml`

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd">
<properties version="1.0">
  <comment>Test run arguments</comment>
  <entry key="iut">https://www.ldproxy.nrw.de/rest/services/kataster/</entry>
</properties>
----

The TestNG results file (`testng-results.xml`) will be written to a subdirectory
in `${user.home}/testng/` having a UUID value as its name.

=== 2. Command shell (console)

One of the build artifacts is an "all-in-one" JAR file that includes the test
suite and all of its dependencies; this makes it very easy to execute the test
suite in a command shell:

`java -jar ets-ogcapi-tiles10-${version}-aio.jar [-o|--outputDir $TMPDIR] [test-run-props.xml]`

=== 3. Docker

This test suite comes with a Dockerfile which can be used to easily setup the OGC test harness with
the test suite.

You need to retrieve the https://hub.docker.com/r/ogccite/ets-ogcapi-tiles10[image from Docker Hub] by running the following

    docker run -p 8081:8080 ogccite/ets-ogcapi-tiles10

Then, open http://localhost:8081/teamengine/ to see below

Login with user and password 'ogctest'

image::img/login-ogccite-02.png[]

Create a new session from the list

image::img/test-session-ogccite-03.png[]

Choose 'OGC' organization then Specification 'OGC API - Tiles - 1.0'

Choose the endpoint URL to test if you query all the endpoints (it could take too long depending of the available datasets for the endpoint)

Wait test execution and see the results from the validator

HTTP calls to localhost are not working with Docker. You need to make calls using host IP (`ipconfig` on Windows or `ifconfig` on Unix based OS like Linux or Mac)

Details can be found on https://github.com/opengeospatial/cite/wiki/How-to-create-Docker-Images-of-test-suites#create-docker-image-and-create-and-start-docker-container[Create Docker Image and create and start Docker Container].

=== 4. OGC test harness

Use https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine[TEAM Engine], the official OGC test harness.
The latest test suite release are usually available at the http://cite.opengeospatial.org/te2/[beta testing facility].
You can also https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine[build and deploy] the test
harness yourself and use a local installation.
